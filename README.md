# FTPServer
There were two projects in CSI516 one is based on PAXSON'96 to take measurement of paths on planet-lab.org with servers in various countries and discover fluttering, triangular detours in packet routing and collecting and plotting the data, along with finding out things like congestion with one server in Europe and one in Australia/New Zealand. The other one is the FTP server in TCP and UDP and analyzing the packets on Wireshark.
The files are JAVA classes only as machine based compilations may throw 'UnsupportedClassVersion' error.
